# Course 3 - Structuring Machine Learning Project

This course in the 5 part specialization didn't have any programming assignments, but in my opinion provided valuable information about how to setup and manage any sizeable Machine Learning project effectively. The course teaches a few methodologies and techniques that are considered good practices in the industry when it comes to making progress in any ML project.

Some of the important concepts taught in this course are -

  * Metrics to evaluate your projects
    - Having a single-valued metric
    - Categorizing the metrics as "Satisfying" and "Optimizing" metrics 
    - Precision and Recall 
    - F1 metrics 
  * Train/Dev/Test sets
    - Their size relative to each other and their distribution 
    - Changing/modifying Train/Dev/Test sets 
  * Avoidable bias 
    - Human perfomance as the proxy for Baye's error
    - Measure of Bias, and measure of Variance 
    - Getting an estimate of Bias and Variance if Dev and Test sets come from different distributions 
  * Error analysis 
    - What errors should be prioritized to be rectified?
    - How to handle incorrectly labeled data?
  * Transfer learning
  * Multitask learning
